## Nice to meet you

Welcome to the Vision Group, and we hope you will have fun as an "eye" in a robot race.

## Choose your first programming language

### Background

The vision group mainly deals with software and algorithms, so the mastery of programming languages ​​is essential, and we need to master C++ and Python.
In previous years, we would learn C++ directly at the beginning. Firstly, it is similar to the C you learned in "Computational Thinking". Secondly, in formal competitions, we will mainly use C++ for performance considerations.
However, based on my personal experience, being exposed to C++ right away may make students who have just entered college from high school and have not been exposed to relevant knowledge feel confused or even anxious, thereby gradually eroding their interest in learning. This may not necessarily be a friendly introduction.
It is true that C++ is a language that is closer to computers, but a language like Python that is closer to natural language may make novices more comfortable.
Therefore, this time we decided to give you the right to choose, but don’t worry, this will not make you fall behind others. Believe me, persisting in learning is the greatest victory in itself.

### C++ VS Python

I'll briefly introduce the advantages and disadvantages of the two languages to help you make a choice.

#### C++

C++ is a high-performance language, adept at low-level programming and hardware interaction. It is closer to the bottom layer, with deeper requirements for memory management and performance optimization, serving as the foundation for robot low-level control, embedded systems, and performance-sensitive fields. Since we pursue speed and performance in robot competitions, C++ will be mainly used.

#### Python

Python is an efficient and easy-to-learn language, popular for its concise syntax and extensive library support. It has a simple grammar that is close to natural language, enabling quick establishment of programming logic and a sense of achievement, making it particularly suitable for algorithm, AI, and rapid prototyping development. We will use Python when we need to use parts related to AI or deep learning, and as a scripting language, we usually use it to build some small tools to assist us.

### How to choose

1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Choose your first programming language: C++ or Python.
3. Under the `students` folder in the corresponding language path, create a `{year}-{name}.md` file and add some information about yourself, such as:
   - Your name
   - Your background (e.g., previous programming experience)
   - Your goals for learning this language
   - Any specific areas of interest within the vision group
Example:

```markdown
# 2025-zhangsan

- Name: Zhang San
- Background: with basic knowledge of C
```

There are no rules for content selection, so you can leave these things out, but you have to at least put something in the file or git won't be able to detect its existence
4. Commit and push your changes to your fork of the repository.
5. Create a pull request to the main repository.
6. Wait for the review and merge of your pull request.

### Notices

We do not recommend that you do this, but if you are truly interested and passionate about learning both programming languages at the same time, we will not stop you, but you will have to deal with the difficulties that come with it yourself.
