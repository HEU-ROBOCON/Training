# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed to be easy to read and write, even for non-technical users, and is often used to format README files, forums, and wikis.

All the documents you see in this repository are written in Markdown. You can use Markdown to write your notes, blog records, resumés...almost anything.
